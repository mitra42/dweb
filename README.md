# dweb

This repo is seriously out of date, 
* the [dweb-gateway repo](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-gateway) has the server side work which incorporates much of this. 
* and most of the rest has moved to Javascript with the transports in [dweb-transports](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-transports) and the higher level in [dweb-objects](https://github.com/internetarchive/dweb-objects)
